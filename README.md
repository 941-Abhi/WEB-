Basics of Web development
This repository contains basic HTML and CSS files I created while practicing web development using Visual Studio Code. It includes simple webpage layouts, styling experiments, and core concepts like forms, buttons, navigation bars, and responsive design. The main goal was to understand the fundamentals of front-end development and build a strong foundation in web design.
